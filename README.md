# Advent of Code 2021
For the first time, I decided to have an attempt at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). My main goal for this is to test my abilities and to try to solve the puzzles. I chose C/C++ for this just for the additional challenge.

# Run my code!
If you have Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 installed, just run the `setup.bat` to set the path to  include `cl`. Then run `build dayXX` to build a specific day.
